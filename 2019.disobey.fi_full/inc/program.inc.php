					<h1>Capture the Flag</h1>

				<div class='cell'>
					<p>The Capture the Flag competition consists of a series of challenges of various difficulty levels.</p>
					<p>
						For each challenge solved you will get a text-based key, called a "flag".<br>
						Each flag can be worth a different amount of points depending on the challenge's difficulty level.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each participant can go solo or in teams and register their flags collected.<br>
						The individual or team with the most points (not the most flags) collected at the end of the competition wins!
