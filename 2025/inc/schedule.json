However, this shift introduces unique risks to both consumer products and critical infrastructure. Identifying, analyzing, and exploiting these vulnerabilities requires some methodologies and specialized tools. In this talk, we will see the potential risks exposed by RF communications, and discuss the techniques and tools necessary to effectively uncover and address these security challenges.",
                "description": "In this keynote, we will explore the opportunities RF interfaces present to attackers, particularly in the domains of electric vehicles (EVs), connected cars, IoT devices, and robotics. Attendees will gain a few insights into the methodologies for SIGINT & COMINT tasks, minimal (\"unexpensive\") setup, and open-source tools we are developing and utilizing to assess and exploit these systems. This presentation will provide a comprehensive overview of RF-based attack surfaces and offer practical techniques for understanding and navigating the vulnerabilities in modern connected technologies.",

Initially applied only at the individual level, OODA loop concepts can now be applied at the organizational level for strategic and tactical benefit. This presentation will cover aspects of critical decisioning and strategic planning while leveraging OODA principals as well as predicting ways the model will be applied in the not to distant future (Organizational Basal Metabolic Rate (OBMR), Organizational Model-Based System Engineering (OMBSE), Enterprise Stress Management (ESM) and potentially paving the way to realize the concept of Ikigai.",

These tokens are cryptographically signed or encrypted and used as proof of users' identity when consuming services.\r\n\r\nThis talk explains two known token-based authentication attacks: stealing tokens (token-replay) and forging tokens. I will cover how adversaries are conducting both attacks and how to detect & protect against them.",
                "description": "Token-based authentication has been out there for over twenty years now. It enabled authenticating to Service Providers (SPs) without sending them usernames and passwords over the network. Token-based authentication is based on trust in an Identity Provider (IdP), which creates tokens to be consumed by SPs.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the trust is implemented using cryptography. The tokens are either signed or encrypted using symmetric or asymmetric cryptography or a combination of them.\r\nThere are at least two techniques to exploit token-based authentication: stealing tokens (aka token-replay) and forging tokens. MITRE has categorised these attacks as T1134/001 and T1606, respectively. Regardless of the technical implementation of the token-based authentication (Kerberos, SAML, OAuth, etc.), the latter requires getting access to used cryptographic secrets.\r\n\r\nIn this demo-packed session, I will cover both token-based authentication attack techniques. First, you will learn how adversaries conduct token-replay attacks and how to protect against them. Second, you will learn how adversaries are forging tokens to impersonate users, how to detect the exploitation, and how to prevent it.\r\n\r\nAlthough the attack techniques are provider-agnostic, I will use Microsoft on-prem and cloud identity platforms for live demos.",

During this presentation, I want to talk about the architecture we chose as well as some of the challenges, weird behaviors, and solutions to these that we found during the development process.",
                "description": "The presentation will start with the history of how we came to develop our own C2 framework. We initially only wanted a way to tunnel arbitrary UDP connections through HTTPS, as we had to quickly develop a \"remote pentest platform\" during the beginning of the pandemic that relied on a UDP-based OpenVPN connection on the outside that was at times hard to get through a customer's firewall. We ended up using the resulting tool (then still called \"RedProxy\") to get a reverse shell via the internet by chaining it together with netcat transmitting UDP packets through it. After that we realized that with a little work we could turn this into a much more generally useful tool.\r\n\r\nAfter the introduction, the talk will discuss the architecture of the full C2 version we renamed to \"Citadel\". The idea for the architecture is based on the ISO/OSI model with strict responsibilities for each (layer) (e.g. \"connectors\" will provide a best-effort communication channel - no more, no less). Challenges that will be discussed when reviewing the details of the architecture and its actual implementation:\r\n- implementing reliable transportation (very similar to TCP: retransmission mechanism, need for congestion control => TCP CUBIC)\r\n- UDP/TCP/SOCKS5/Unix tunneling (tunnel teardown is surprisingly challenging!)\r\n- implementation of connectors for various network protocols (HTTPS, WebSockets, DNS, ICMP, Gmail drafts, SMB Named Pipes, etc.)\r\n- forwarding traffic between agents (not every agent talks directly with the C2 server; routing and congestion issues)\r\n- how we defend ourselves against sandboxes (\"lobby\" where we manually have to approve stagers before they get the full payload)\r\n- managing discovered credentials (giving individual agents access, in-memory encryption, PTH/PTT)\r\n- details about our internal end-to-end encryption between agents and the C2 server (based on TLS, but had to roll our own encryption protocol, which was/is scary)\r\n- in-memory loading of third-party .NET tools like SharpHound or Rubeus (how to make them unloadable via placing them in a separate AppDomain; differences in how this can be done in old .NET Framework and more modern .NET; limitations we couldn't get around so far)\r\n- adding support for Beacon Object Files so we can reuse all the awesome BOFs out there\r\n- how we obfuscate our binaries (.NET code after all is very easily decompilable)\r\n- our scripting engine and how we use it for continuous integration testing\r\n- a bunch of smaller features that make our lives easier",

                "abstract": "Most Endpoint Detection & Response solutions (‘EDRs’) heavily rely on analysing process events for detecting suspicious behaviour; in particular, command-line arguments are inspected for keywords or character sequences that may indicate malicious activity. This is still common practice, despite the widely known fact that a process’ command line can be altered, hidden, or otherwise spoofed, which may bypass such defensive measures.\r\n\r\nLesser known is that, particularly on Windows operating systems, there is a wealth of system-native programs that happily accept ‘unexpected’ command-line transformations, such as character substitutions, deletions or insertions. An implication of this is that command-line-based detections can be bypassed with minimal effort, and unlike command-line spoofing, without the need for special system calls. Tools vulnerable to this include those often leveraged in attacks that ‘live off the land’ (also known as LOLBins or LOLBAS). \r\n\r\nThis talk will show, based on empirical analysis of the 60 most commonly used LOLBins, how many detections can bypassed making minimal tweaks to how a LOLBins are called. Furthermore, we will introduce a new web-based tool that not only documents the results for all these executables, it allows everyone to generate obfuscated command lines themselves with the click of a button.",

                "abstract": "In today’s rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape, the sheer number of security tools available to scan your pipeline is constantly increasing. With new tools entering the market at an unprecedented pace, it can be challenging to manage overlapping findings and determine which tools excel in specific areas. The overwhelming amount of data generated can make it difficult to focus remediation efforts and build a comprehensive security posture.\r\n\r\nVulnerability management tools like [DefectDojo](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo) address this challenge by correlating findings from various security tools, including SAST, DAST, SCA scanners, and image/container/posture scanners, presenting them on a single pane of glass. By creating a data model of your product stack and security engagements, and enriching it with metadata such as internet exposure and criticality, security management can make informed decisions on prioritizing vulnerability mitigation and remediation across your product range.\r\n\r\n[DefectDojo](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo) enables the triage of findings—filtering out non-applicable findings, false positives, and deduplication—prior to assigning them as work items, regardless of the source. While traditional process-based approaches can still be utilized, [DefectDojo](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo) offers users the capability to automate much of the process. Allowing teams to run multiple security tools in parallel, comparing their outputs to determine the most effective solutions for your security needs.\r\n\r\n**Why is this important?** According to the Verizon 2024 Data Breach Investigations Report ([verizon.com/dbir](https://verizon.com/dbir)), accelerating the patching of critical vulnerabilities is crucial. By filtering out irrelevant data and enabling developers to focus on quickly remediating critical vulnerabilities through risk-based SLAs, you can significantly reduce the time from vulnerability disclosure to remediation. Additionally, integrating tools through APIs and automating the processing, prioritization, deduplication, and assignment of findings to the appropriate developers further increases remediation velocity.",
                "description": "My talk will focus on the challenges we’ve faced juggling multiple security tools in our pipeline and trying to assign meaningful work items to developers through automation. I will describe how we’ve transitioned from a tool-focused pipeline to a centrally managed solution and discuss the benefits for individual developers, service owners, managers, and security responsibles.\r\n\r\nI will use [DefectDojo](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo) as an example, an open-source tool for managing vulnerabilities across products and security tools. I will provide real-world examples of how we’ve modelled our microservice-based SaaS solution within [DefectDojo](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo) and integrated various security finding sources to feed the vulnerability management plane. I’ll discuss the developer experiences as well as my own perspective as the product security lead of a global SaaS solution.\r\n\r\nUsing flexible data models and open metadata to reflect your unique product landscape and security operations, security champions can make informed decisions on prioritizing vulnerability mitigation and remediation across your product range.",

                "description": "This talk will be broken down into 4 parts.\r\nFirst establishing what our environment is. What is just like every other web application and what differs. Both in amount of data and how that data might look.\r\nThen after a short introduction we focus on what makes games and gaming unique as targets for attacks. Both the game itself, the company behind it, how a lot of the normal risks are the same. Then what is unique with accounts being valuable, items, attacking the game itself. Where good users tend to not want to abuse an application, a good player might be tempted to abuse a game.\r\nA short introduction to botting and how it has evolved over the years, into today when AI have made it more difficult than ever to fully identify if its a player or a bot behind the player character that have been mining iron for 18 hours in a row.\r\nTouch on the industry behind gold farmers from poor countries, where digital currency is very real.\r\nThen how games can be used to attack other players or the community itself, through harassment, scams, RCE, doxing.\r\n\r\nAfter that we look at detection and tie back to the attacks. Which can we detect, what would need to be logged, is it a pin in an ocean of data. What is the cost of detection, what patterns can be used to minimize the need for it, is anti-cheat a sensible option.\r\nThe cat and mouse game that comes with detection. It is never just once.\r\n\r\nThen how to defend, based on our detection, what we can and can not do, why some common patterns are seen to minimize what we can not do or what is costly to do.\r\nHow certain problems used to be very difficult (ban-lists of words, rude words, harassment) where LLM actually can be helpful (identify words, are they rude)\r\nThe need for automation and how if we catch everything, we still need to automate the response to them or we will burn through every last employee.\r\nAnd then touching yet again on the players and how difficult it is to defend someone that might not care or know better. Can't send them to training. So how do you ensure good security practice when \"hunter2\" still works just as well today as it did back in the days.",

In 2022, we carried out a literature review on DevOps security postures and greatest challenges for software development. The BSIMM framework was used for organizing the data.\r\nSynopsis corporation has gathered data from over 130 organizations by using the BSIMM software security maturity framework. This provided us a chance to compare findings from our study using the academic sources with those from real industry, and also with regard to timeline covering 2019-2024.\r\nTop findings of our academic literature review on 2022 were:\r\n1) People have been complaining about security being considered too late on the software development cycle for ages, still we did not identify that security postures would cover the whole development cycle.\r\n2) DevOps development is carried out on a multi-complex environment.\r\n3) DevOps style even brings in novel challenges for software security. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, \r\n1) First, challenges and common postures for software security from the2022 literature review are summarized; the findings related to DevOps development style are discussed in more detail than in the original research.\r\n2) Secondly, we  compare the results with the findings of the most recent BSIMM research.\r\n3) Thirdly, we discuss the trend of integrating security into DevOps in the light of this analysis covering 4 years.\r\n\r\nBy our analysis, we conclude that \r\n-it seems that DevOps brings additional challenges to secure software development\r\n-As more and more software is produced by using AI, uttermost care should be taken to train the AI with the code models that take security into consideration.\r\n\r\nWe challenge you to:\r\nMake a world better – one software development project at time (this happens when you go home and see anyone forgetting the security on their software development postures).",

As cyber offense increasingly resembles special forces with their slick coordination and laser-focused missions, as seen in Hollywood movies, many enterprises continue to flounder in outdated management structures and a consensus-oriented mindset that cannot contend with this emerging breed of adversary. To stand a chance, defenders must not only understand their opponents' end game and strategies but also be trained to engage at a comparable level. Drawing on years of personal hands-on experience in both offensive and defensive activities, this keynote will provide insights into the \"behind the scenes\" aspects of the strategic and tactical planning of state-sponsored cyber operations and explain why the public sector has been drawn into organized hybrid warfare without consent. By focusing on the limitations of business-oriented environments and civilian mindsets when defending against resourceful, mission-oriented threat actors, this talk aims to stimulate the audience’s independent thinking and reasoning about the necessary changes in problem-solving, decision-making, and leadership in \"left-behind\" nonmilitant defense.",

The data stolen by infostealers have been utilized in a number of notorious attacks. In this talk we will start by introducing main concepts related to infostealers, such as ftw are these kind of badness, what kind of data is collected, infection vectors. Next, the talk will go through the infostealer cybercriminal environment; which will set up a stage for the part where we look at the monetisation and abuse methods of stolen data collected by infostealers, colloquially referred as (malware/infostealer) logs, and include review of marketplaces where the data is sold. Finally, we will amuse ourselves by the speaker’s poor attempts on data analysis, where the presenter will show insights gained from the public dumps of infostealer logs.\r\n\r\nThe talk is suitable for all kind of audience and very light on technical details.",

Further, we'll transition into the latest and hottest trend in software security: Supply-chain attacks.\r\n\r\nAs a grand finale, we'll talk about Cross-Build Injection as a pivot point and advanced persistence in the Java build pipeline.

                "description": "Years of working with application security in the financial services sector, we've made some concerning observations:\r\n1) A lot of government and financial services in the Nordic are written in Java.\r\n2) The typical methodology of security testing is based on known exploits for running services.\r\n3) There's a looming trend of supply-chain attacks targeting the software development life-cycle.\r\n4) Security teams have little to no insight into what's coming.\r\n\r\nWe take the audience on a journey from the landscape of traditional Java exploitation to the emerging field of software supply-chain attacks. We survey traditional attack patterns for Java services and shed light on their limitations. Blue teams will receive some advice on how to spot most exploits against Java-based systems. Red teams will learn how to remain stealthy by \"living off the Java land\" by staying inside the JVM.\r\n\r\nWe've taken a particular interest in supply-chain attack paths. Our research indicates that this is a growing threat that few organizations are equipped to manage (think of what happened with the xz project). We delve deep into the world of Java, Maven, build pipelines and covert persistence within the world of Java. To spice things up, we've developed a tool that red teams can use to make covert supply-chain attacks viable for security testing. We showcase Cross-Build Injection attacks through a custom malware that targets Java build environments, creating a form of advanced persistence and pivoting path in target organizations. We've spoken to vendors in the AppSec space and, as it stands, we don't know of any product that can reliably detect this attack.\r\n\r\nBy shedding light on the emerging threat of build-time attacks - and by providing a newly developed tool for red teams to simulate such attacks - we urge the audience to test and prepare for this emerging threat.",

Standard security practices include the use of dedicated administration accounts, Privileged Identity Management (PIM), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requirements, and Conditional Access Policies to safeguard and protect the environment.\r\nHowever, there are dangers that sometimes go unnoticed. In on-premise Active Directory, issues such as credential caching (dumping via tools like Mimikatz), NTLM attacks (including NTLM relay and Net-NTLM hash cracking), among others, enable ransomware threat actors to move laterally within a matter of hours.\r\nEntra ID, a recent and complex technology, is not exempt from these issues. As best practices continue to evolve, there is room for misconfigurations that can be just as exploitable.\r\nIn my presentation, I will elucidate how poor practices and misconfigurations in Enterprise Applications and GDAP can lead to an exponential supply chain attack.

                "description": "Outline:\r\n\r\n## I. Opening Story: The AdminDroid Incident\r\n* **Introduction to AdminDroid**: AdminDroid is marketed as a locally installed software solution for Microsoft 365 auditing/reporting, designed to support multiple tenants (MSP/MSSP). It boasts a global user base of over 30,000 companies, including industry giants such as Audi, Coca Cola, Samsung, PayPal, Emirates, Walt Disney Pictures, Intel, Dell, Adidas, Symantec, and IBM. This wide adoption highlights its perceived utility and trustworthiness within the corporate world.\r\n* **Discovery of a Critical issue**: Upon investigation, I uncovered that AdminDroid regularly transmits global admin tokens for Azure Graph to the vendor every hour. This alarming practice grants the vendor the capability to access and modify customer data and environments without authorization. The implications are dire, especially if the vendor's environment is breached, posing a significant risk to all connected clients.\r\n* **The Issue of Customer Awareness**: It is my belief that this functionality comes as an unwelcome surprise to customers, who opted for AdminDroid under the impression of it being a fully on-premise solution. This discrepancy between expectation and reality underlines a critical issue in vendor transparency and customer understanding of the product's operational mechanics.\r\n\r\n## II. Who Am I\r\n\r\n## III. Entra ID - Why Bother?\r\n* **Cloud Accessibility**: Entra ID's cloud service is globally accessible, introducing unique security challenges.\r\n* **Market Penetration**: Its widespread adoption makes it nearly universal, indicating a significant reliance across companies.\r\n* **Systemic Importance**: As a Tier 0 service (Identity Provider), compromising Entra ID puts the entire system at risk.\r\n* **Evolving Practices**: The technology's novelty and complexity mean that best practices are still forming, leading to a higher chance of misconfigurations.\r\n \r\n## IV. Supply chain - The Exponential Potential\r\n* **Interconnectivity**: In Entra ID, every entity is someone's supplier and someone's customer. Hence, many of the 30,000 companies could have some level of access to other companies' Entra ID systems.\r\n* **Cloud-Based Nature**: Unlike on-prem solutions, with Entra ID, there's no need to wait for backdoor deployment or worry about bypassing firewalls or endpoint detection and response systems. It offers direct access to all Entra ID tenants globally.\r\n* **Standardized Environment**: The uniformity of Entra ID enables the possibility to write recursive code that exploits misconfigurations and weaknesses, potentially compromising a vast number of companies within minutes. \r\n    \r\n## V. Demonstration\r\n* **Key Areas of Focus**: GDAP, Multitenant Enterprise Applications, and Key Vaults.\r\n* **Exploitation Pathways**: TAP, authentication methods, and Service Principal Secrets.\r\n* **PoC**: Demonstrate an attack strategy that conducts reconnaissance and exploitation across Entra ID environments, showcasing recursive inter-company lateral movement.\r\n\r\n## VI. Minimizing the Risks\r\n* **GDAP Review**: Identifying and addressing vulnerabilities.\r\n* **Application Assessment**: Evaluating enterprise applications privileges.\r\n* **Exploitation Detection**: Strategies for detecting an attack.\r\n\r\n## VII. Conclusion\r\n* **Recognizing the Greater Threat**: While the cybersecurity risks associated with excessive numbers of overprivileged users and the absence of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Conditional Access (CA) are well-known, supply-chain attacks represent a potentially larger threat vector. These types of attacks pose a unique challenge, as organizations might not have the capability to assess which external parties could potentially gain full access to their environment.",

                "abstract": "IPMI, a protocol many will never have heard of, underpins remote access to some of the most critical elements of server infrastructure. The years have not been kind to IPMI, and research has repeatedly found flaws in these systems. As part of our talk we will explore new issues that have been discovered following our research and how they impact an open source IPMI implementation. \r\nThe talk will provide technical background on what Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs) are, the role they play in our infrastructure, and how they can be abused to grant privileged access to servers across the world. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, we'll look at protocol exploitation and state machine analysis, explaining the steps taken to analyse remote management protocols, how audience members can use this to analyse other protocols, and how this resulted in discovering critical flaws in IPMI and other software, allowing remote administrative access to server infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe main takeaways from the presentation will be:\r\n - Learning about the IPMI protocol (maybe TLS/WPA too)\r\n - showing off some interesting vulns\r\n - Learning about protocol research methodology, and how to design secure protocols",
                "description": "Full disclosure, this is a high-level overview of the research and the topics that will be covered in the conference talk. My plan is to focus on one particular piece of research / series of vulnerabilities against a particular piece of software, however the research is still ongoing. There were high risk vulnerabilities discovered, but these are going through responsible disclosure and remediation processes currently. Additionally, there have been some recent updates requiring re-evaluation of the exploit routes, and disclosure discussions that might affect ability to discuss this publicly. \r\n\r\nAs a backup or alternative approach depending on the responsible disclosure timelines, to present other examples of exploitation research (that didn't result in actual vulnerabilities) showing similar ideas in other protocols, that could be discussed more generally. Any additional content that is discovered will be restructured into the general outline of the talk to fit within the allocated 45 minutes.\r\n\r\nHere is the outline of slides/talk I have planned so far: the URL for the proposal slides is another presentation from my company, I will be using a template similar to this , but with the content below, these are only for visual comparison :)\r\n\r\n# Speaker + talk intro \r\n\r\n# Background \r\n\r\n- What are BMC's, What's IPMI, and why are they important? \r\n- discuss previous research into IPMI and BMC firmware: \r\n- 2013: significant flaws in IPMI protocol: weaknesses still exist today \r\n- 2013 -> today: multiple vulnerabilities discovered in different vendor's BMC firmware \r\n\r\n# Analysis of IPMI \r\n\r\n- origins of our research project: fuzzing IPMI\r\n- Discuss the techniques and stages of protocol analysis undertaken \r\n  - code analysis \r\n  - fuzzing \r\n  - state machine analysis* < emphasis will be on this \r\n  - debugging \r\n  - cryptographic analysis \r\n  - exploit refinement \r\n\r\n  For each of these techniques we will present a set of relevant code snippets, examples,, command lines, and used tools. Aim will be to provide a quick demonstration of  how this process can be followed to reproduce and conduct analysis of other tools and protocols across the industry. \r\n\r\n# Discovered vulnerabilities \r\n\r\n- Illustrate how the techniques above lead to discovery of vulnerabilities in IPMI \r\n- Show how these could be combined into exploit primitives \r\n- Finally: show how these are combined into more complex exploit chains \r\n- Demo of discovered vulns against a virtual machine \r\n\r\n# Fixes \r\n\r\n- link back to vulnerabilities and show how to fix these issues \r\n- discuss wrt. protocol security in general, and how we can build more secure protocol services \r\n\r\n# Follow on analysis \r\n\r\n- How did we attempt to discover the public exposure (which turned out to be ~0)? \r\n- How can other researchers use the same methodology to identify these services? \r\n- discuss interesting observations from this \r\n\r\n# Conclusion \r\n\r\n- wrap up thoughts on protocol security takeaways \r\n- show how people can apply this research to other fields",

                "abstract": "Microsoft are improving their cloud platform by providing more log sources that can be consumed to gain visibility into enumeration and data read events. However, due to Azure's complexity, such as different legacy and modern systems, the same objective can be achieved by an attacker through different methods, inherently with different indicators. As a result, the challenges that organisations face, and will continue on facing, are the following:\r\n\r\n- Attackers using known and lesser-known APIs to perform activities against a tenant and Azure resources.\r\n- Attackers remaining undetected due to assumptions taken by defensive teams in how specific attacks would be performed.\r\n\r\nThis talk will aim to build up on publicly available research into undocumented APIs within Azure and present different ways that attackers can use these APIs to gather information about an environment and also perform actions against the estate. With each method that is discussed, the talk will also present what controls exist to try and prevent their abuse within an organisation as well as what telemetry is generated when performing these attacks. Thus, allowing attendees to understand the available attack surface within Azure and help provide guidance on the potential non-typical log sources that should be ingested to improve an attack detection in an estate.",
                "description": "General structure of the slides will be the following:\r\n\r\nWill begin with an introduction to the topic of the different APIs that exist within Azure/Entra. This is to give enough context to all people in the audience and set the scene for how these APIs interact with each other. This will then be followed up with an explanation of the particular APIs that will be shown which will be the Ibiza API and the PIM API within Entra/Azure. \r\n\r\nLastly the talk will move to a simulated/example case study from the perspective of a compromised user in Entra. First usage of the more well-known Microsoft Graph API will be shown to showcase that logs are indeed generated for read/enumeration events there within Entra. Then equivalent user enumeration actions will be performed using the other APIs in order to show that logs would not be generated from those APIs while still providing similar information as the Graph API. \r\n\r\nTalk will then finish up with a primer on the available recommendations on how to tackle this challenge from a defender's perspective and where effort should be focused. And then finish with an overall summary.\r\n\r\nFor full disclosure, as the talk was presented at fwd:cloudsec EU 2024 the slides from the original version can be found here for evaluation purposes and consideration for the conference (https://fwdcloudsec.org/assets/presentations/2024/europe/christian-philipov-staying-sneaky-in-azure.pdf). \r\n\r\nThe slides should largely remain similar but with the additional time am considering expanding the examples and having a live demo or at least a screen recording (as it takes an unforeseen amount of time for logs to be generated in the cases where they exist for events. As such, to avoid wasting time waiting for logs will prepare a cut recording.",

How does such a system even look like from DFIR perspective, and how would an adversary approach attacking them?\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will teach you some basics of Industrial Control Systems (ICS), explain what a successful cyber attack against an ICS system often looks like, and finally present my personal opinion on how investigating an ICS incident differs from investigating a compromised IT system. If you've never heard about the ICS Cyber Kill Chain or don't know what a PLC or an RTU is, then this talk is for you!",

SMM, a privileged execution mode in x86_64 processor architecture, operates at the lowest level of the CPU privilege rings; beneath even the kernel's ring 0 or hypervisor’s “ring -1” - SMM executes in so-called “ring -2”. This makes it an ideal environment for executing anything undetected by traditional detection software typically running in higher privilege rings, be it anti-cheat or anti-virus software. \r\n\r\nWe will cover the technical details of how to use SMM, its inherent advantages over other cheating techniques, and the challenges in interfacing with game memory and game object types while remaining undetected from the most established anti-cheat platforms. This talk will include a demonstration of a working game cheat which can bypass modern anti-cheat tools and a deep dive into the potential implications for anti-cheat developers (and other security professionals whose job it is to detect malicious activity in their context). Attendees will leave with a solid understanding of why SMM is a powerful tool for stealth in executing code maliciously and what countermeasures might be required to combat such sophisticated attacks.",

Basic firmware\r\n\t - SMM modules are stored in and loaded from system firmware (UEFI) image\r\n\t - edk2 (UEFI)\r\n\t\t - Defacto standard for UEFI images\r\n\t\t - Sets up a lot of features & \"libraries\" already so we have it easier\r\n\t\t - [Github](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2)\r\n - Runs lower than even the Hypervisor on the system\r\n\t - Show traditional ring slide with extra rings -1 (hypervisor) and -2 (SMM)\r\n\t - SMM's memory cannot be accessed from upper protection rings if the manufacturer did not change the default settings\r\n - SMM is only entered upon System Management Interrupts (SMIs)#\r\n\t- After SMI is received, all cores will enter SMM\r\n\t- Rendezvouz will await for all cores by default\r\n\t- CPU has to first get setup, on modern plattforms edk2 already takes care of that\r\n\t\t- Sets up Long mode for 64 bit operations\r\n\t- State of execution is saved and restored upon entry\r\n\t\t- Similar as in Hypervisors\r\n- SMM has access to all memory and components in the system\r\n\t- Depending on the underlying system, OS virtual memory can be a challenge\r\n\t\t- Example: Hypervisor with multi level pagle tables\r\n\t- Registers that were saved can also be modified -> change normal operation behavior without it noticing\r\n- Where is the code saved?\r\n\t- On a SPI chip on the mainboard (SOIC8 / SOP8 format)\r\n\t- Access is possible from external or from the system itself (more on that later)\r\n### Challenges and Limitations\r\n- SMM has to be entered somehow first\r\n- Floating point operations\r\n\t- Not set up by edk2\r\n- Normal interrupts\r\n\t- Not handled in SMM\r\n### Debugging\r\n- How would you debug this?\r\n\t- Deploy the custom firmware in a virtual machine with a hypervisor that supports custom firmware (KVM/QEMU)\r\n\t\t- Introspection from outside the VM\r\n\t- Serial communication\r\n\t\t- Some modern boards still have the connector\r\n\t\t- Simply setup the port and send data out, start from a serial \"Hello world\" SMM module\r\n\t\t- No interrupts required for basic communication (just call outportb, inportb)\r\n\t- Debugging features\r\n\t\t- Requires you to actually boot the system\r\n\t\t- Use memory buffer to communicate\r\n\t\t- Example project: \r\n\t\t\t- By us [Hermes](https://github.com/pRain1337/hermes)\r\n\t\t\t\t- Our version is made to be more stealthy (doesnt execute SMI# by itself, just has a memory buffer)\r\n\t\t\t\t- Only compatible with Windows\r\n\t\t\t- More features, OS support by cr4sh [SmmbackdoorNg](https://github.com/Cr4sh/SmmBackdoorNg)\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to use SMM for a game cheat\r\n### Why even use SMM for a game cheat?\r\n- Better question, why not?\r\n\t- Stealth is built in, its perfect\r\n\t- SMM exists on every computer already altough it can be considered legacy by some\r\n\t- Technique itself gets talked about in the game cheating scene, but only very few projects released\r\n\t\t- [ekknod](https://github.com/ekknod/smm)\r\n\t\t\t- After installation, put PC in sleep mode to trigger a SMI and set a variable in the game to enable ESP\r\n\t\t- [Zepta](https://github.com/Oliver-1-1/SmmInfect)\r\n\t\t\t- Similar to Hermes, less features\r\n- Our thought for this project:\r\n\t- Instead of using the existing techniques which are known by anticheats, use something completly new\r\n\t\t- In our opinion, hiding something always introduces a larger detection surface than not hiding at all\r\n### Disclaimer\r\n - Project was done in the last year for educational and scientific purposes and as a challenge to bypass the most modern and most advanced anti-cheats\r\n### What do we want to implement?\r\n - Typical features (Aimbot, Sound ESP, Radar)\r\n - Goal is that everything is running fully in SMM\r\n\t - No execution required in the underlying operating system\r\n### How to implement?\r\n#### Pain points\r\n- We need to get execution in SMM\r\n\t- If we run everything in SMM, we need a lot of SMI because modern games happen real-time - we need to update data at a high frequency\r\n\t- Known possibilities:\r\n\t\t- Intel PCH features timers that will regulary trigger a SMI\r\n\t\t- Either they are not that fast (only a couple per second) or they halt the system on modern chipsets\r\n\t\t\t- We requested for manuals that explain the undocumented parts of SMI generation in public specs, but Intel required us to sign an NDA for further information...\r\n- We need to interact with the user/system to actually achieve a benefit\r\n- No interrupts -> cant just stay in SMM and overwrite when there is incoming data\r\n\t- Wanting it to be stealthy -> no component running on the operating system\r\n\t- Direct modification of data in kernel would work, but it would enlargen the detection surface and therefore we would get caught sooner or later\r\n#### Solution\r\n- SMI generation on XHCI events!\r\n\t- Initial idea presented by Joshua Schiffman and David Kaplan (The SMM Rootkit Revisited: Fun with USB, 2014)\r\n\t\t- Initial approach would modify interrupt registers in the XHCI, but we found a much better feature\r\n\t-\tIntel PCH and XHCI controller feature built-in bits to leave the normal interrupt flow and generate a SMI on each USB event\r\n\t\t-\tWe get a lot of execution (as gaming mice run at high frequency) and even get the execution exactly when there is incoming data!\r\n\t-\tThis allows us to parse the structures of the XHCI, find the right USB device, find the USB endpoint that is used for data transfer and find the transfer buffer used by it\r\n\t-\tThus, we can modify incoming/outgoing data from USB packets without the operating system noticing\r\n\t\t-\tExample 1: a mouse\r\n\t\t\t-\tHID protocol used, can just modify the x,y coordinates for an aimbot\r\n\t\t- Example 2: a sound device (speaker, headphones...)\r\n\t\t\t- Sound data is transported out, we can just write data to produce noise which can easily be distinguished by the user\r\n\t- Any drawbacks? Yes...\r\n\t\t- Modern USB devices (especially gaming mouses) have a high polling rate, means we have to be quick in SMM as we get a lot of CPU SMM <--> userspace context switches!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n- Prepare a computer where the game cheat is already installed on the SPI chip\r\n\t- Installing otherwise might take 10 minutes and sometimes the SOIC8 clip dont hold onto properly\r\n - Connect USB speaker to computer\r\n - Connect serial cable to second device for debug output\r\n - Start game (Counter-Strike 2) and go to a local server\r\n - Wait a couple second until debug output shows it worked -> noise should be heard when hovering over an enemy behind a wall\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to install?\r\n - Depends on how modern the computer is\r\n\t - Installing from operating system gets harder, but is not impossible\r\n- Way that nearly always works for installation:\r\n\t- SOIC8 Clip and using Flashrom\r\n\t- Some mainboard dont have the chips exposed or other formats -> can get complicated\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to detect such a cheat?\r\n - Some possibilities which can show clear proof that a cheat is actually used\r\n\t - More possibilities exist, but they dont show a cheat is used, more that the SPI was modified\r\n### Memory side channel honeypot\r\n- Original idea from [Everdox](https://web.archive.org/web/20211229210102/https:/twitter.com/nickeverdox/status/1476295914423656456) (Anti-Cheat Developer at Riot)\r\n- Implementation by [h33p](https://github.com/h33p/side-channels)\r\n- Uses analytics on the latency of CPU cache lines\r\n- Basic terms:\r\n\t- Create a memory honeypot in the game memory\r\n\t- Modify the game so the honeypot is in the actual structures (example a fake player object) and that the real game would never actually access this object\r\n\t\t- Now monitor the latency of accessing that cache line\r\n\t\t\t- If the latency goes down sometime it means that something on the system is accessing it\r\n\t- Now repeat this, plant multiple honeypots and if the behavior keeps repeating, it means something is repeatedly parsing the game player structures\r\n\t- Simple fix is disabling the cache in SMM before accessing it\r\n\t\t- Performance loss is noticeable so no real fix\r\n### SPI dumping & analyzing\r\n- DXE to SMM vulnerabilities exist, but it is more likely that the cheat is stored in the SPI chip itself\r\n- Basically read the content of the chip on the mainboard and check for malicious modules\r\n\t- Commercial tools exist for exactly this\r\n\t- Then just parse the SPI dump and extract the modules (UEFITool / UEFIExtract)\r\n\t- One problem:\r\n\t\t- Modules are not signed / certified, you will have to build the database of known modules yourself\r\n - Cheat could prevent this by blocking SPI reads using PCH features (Protected range registers)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Future work\r\n- What other stuff would be possible using SMM?\r\n\t- Simple backdoors for HyperV debugging, Cr4sh [SmmbackdoorNg](https://github.com/Cr4sh/SmmBackdoorNg)\r\n\t- System introspection framework [Spectre](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6575343)\r\n\t- Cloud resource usage monitoring [Scotch](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-66332-6_18)\r\n\t- Runtime I/O device security checks [IOCheck](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6615523)\r\n- With edk2 the barrier of entry is relatively low, hardest thing is getting the compilation working one time!\r\n\r\n\r\n# Bonus slides (not actual content of the presentation)\r\n## Introduction to SMM\r\n- Where is the SMM code saved?\r\n\t- SPI chip\r\n\t\t- SOIC8 / SOP8 Chips\r\n\t - Access possible from the operation system itself (MMIO / IO) \r\n## How to install the cheat\r\n- EFI Shell / afudos / manufacturer tools\r\n\t- Worked in the past years, now limited on most devices using Protected range registers\r\n- Mainboard features\r\n\t- Asus Flashback\r\n\t\t- Exists on their more premium line\r\n\t\t- Specific USB port for flashing\r\n\t\t- Plug USB with image with proper name in and press the flashback button on a turned off system\r\n\t\t- Preboot environment will not check anything and happily flash the modified UEFI firmware with a malicious SMM module\r\n## How to detect the cheat\r\n- Methods which are only an indication but not clear proof\r\n### MSR_SMI_COUNT\r\n- Intel provides this neat feature, shows you the amount of SMI since power\r\n\t- Full SMM cheat will be running a lot of times in SMM -> high amount\r\n\t- MSR Spoof not possible by itself using just SMM / PCH features\r\n\t\t - Only by using a hypervisor or modifying the OS\r\n\t - Means: No clear evidence of cheat, but suspicious\r\n### Time delay\r\n- Similar as how an anticheat might detect a hypervisor\r\n- Time spent in SMM can be detected by analyzing TSC or other clocks (HPC)\r\n- Nowadays harder to run due to HVCI which forces a Hypervisor\r\n- Means: No clear evidence of cheat, but suspicious\r\n### TPM measurement for boot PCR\r\n- Can be used to measure the SPI even if the read fails\r\n- Shows a deviation from the expected hash\r\n\r\n## How to prevent such a cheat\r\n### Intel Bios Guard and Boot Guard\r\n- System would not boot/flash a modified image\r\n- Mostly implemented on business devices, not mainboard for build-your-own-pc (Mostly used by gamers)\r\n- There will always be manufacturers that won't implement it, as it means more expenses and end users (gamers) don't require it\r\n- Means: Can't be enforced for everyone by an Anticheat, but for selected people (when playing for money as example)\r\n### SPI Protected range registers (PRR)\r\n- Only blocks the installing of the cheat, nowadays done by most manufacturers\r\n\t- Prevents flashing from the OS \r\n\t- Manufacturer still needs to support flashing from OS\r\n\t\t- Possible exploitation of manufacturer tools to flash modified images!\r\n- Makes the effort bigger the user needs to do to install the cheat\r\n### SMI Transfer Monitor (STM)\r\n- Basically a hypervisor for SMM\r\n- Can restrict what SMM modules are allowed to access etc.\r\n- Might come in the future, but manufacturer will take a long time until it is deployed on all systems\r\n- Paper: PSEC2018-STM-PE-Eugene-Myers",
