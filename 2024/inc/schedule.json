Also, the idea is to show how to possibly lift firmware from range of devices and offer an easy'ish solution to build your boot camp for HW-hacking. No soldering or super wonky equipment required to start hacking, easy entry-level!",

Presenter has tried several different approaches, some has failed, some succeeded and wants to share his own best-practises with the wider community. After this presentation hopefully there will be some folks who will continue the HW-journey on their own with some new approaches and ideas. We'll be talking about non-soldering/soldering approaches, nrf5340DK boards, lifting firmwares, debugging on hardware itself and which methods has been found useful and which definetly not. Presentation also includes a real-life example of taking back control of your very own home router!",

                "abstract": "**What if I told you that your code security is not enough?** You need to ensure your deployment is secure as well! Developing Software-as-a-Service applications requires security both from a development perspective as well as from a deployment perspective. Facts: \r\n- The Verizon 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report shows that misconfigurations are a persistent cause for data breaches over the years and account for a fair chunk of confirmed breaches [(verizon.com/dbir)](https://verizon.com/dbir).\r\n- According to [OWASP Top 10:2021](https://owasp.org/Top10), in 90% of the applications they examined, they found some form of misconfiguration.\r\n\r\nThis is where Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) solutions come into play. They work as a bridge between security, operations and development to ensure the code is deployed in a secure fashion and helps organizations avoid breaches due to configuration errors.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter if your code has zero vulnerabilities based on your sophisticated SAST/DAST/IAST scans and if you've ensured your third-party libraries are all patched using your state-of-the-art SCA scans if your cloud configuration allows unauthorized access to your object storage. In addition, underlying configuration mistakes can lead to disaster when an attacker chains their attacks and is able to escalate their privileges, move laterally or establish persistence.",
                "description": "In my talk I will describe our experiences in incorporating cloud security posture management into our DevOps workflow and how that has helped us work with configuration issues in a collaborative fashion. \r\n\r\nSome of the topics I will cover are:\r\n\r\n- Our approach to triaging findings\r\n- How we embed cloud configuration management into our CI/CD pipelines\r\n- Examples of how CSPM rules can be used to align to organizational policies\r\n- Examples of where configuration management helped us avoid disaster\r\n- Tips on where to get started with CSPM\r\n\r\nI'll also share my personal experiences as the Product Security Lead for SAS Customer Intelligence solutions and how a generalist non-developer like me can use tools such as CSPM to bridge the gap between controls in a compliance framework to actual code & configuration and how CSPM helps discussion between compliance & development.",

The presentation will focus on the MOVEit MFT related SQLi vulnerability, which was disclosed in May 2023. Before public disclosure, cl0p was already actively exploiting the vulnerability. By exploiting the vulnerability, cl0p gained access to the MFT application and exfiltrated all data stored in the application. This presentation presents the activities of the ransomware group, a timeline from reconnaissance to exfiltration, and an analysis of the backdoor used by the attacker. The presentation is built on investigation notes from real incident response investigations and make recommendations for organisations using MFT applications to minimize the risk in the future.",

But, by embracing these conveniences, how much are we giving up in the process via the apps they need to function?\r\n\r\nWe're going to take a look at a couple of apps that accompany these smart devices throughout this talk. We'll start with diving into the privacy policies of each to see just how up-front they are about the data they're collecting and who it gets shared with/sold to. After that, we'll move onto where the data is going, how often it gets collected, and ultimately which third parties also get to know you.",

The talk will be broken down into the following sections:\r\n\r\n1. Collection up front: what exactly does the privacy policy for each say? How transparent is each company about what they collect? What data do they keep vs share/sell? Who exactly are the \"third parties and other partners\" that get the data collected?\r\n\r\n2. What can be inferred from this data collection? Why is it even valuable in the first place? \r\n\r\n3.

We will revisit a vulnerability class thats been dormant for over two decades, dig into old terminal injection research and log tampering techniques from the 80-90s, and combine them with new features. With the pure intention to create chaos and mischief in the modern cloud cli’s, mobile, and feature-rich DevOps terminal emulators of today. Shine some light on the consequences, and learn how and why we should avoid passing on malicious escape sequences into our logfiles.

A highly successful career in cyber security or\r\n2. A highly successful career in cybercrime.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, many youngsters pick the latter choice, starting off as innocent script kiddies and progressing bit by bit, each time getting a little more risky.

However, underneath the hype, it has some serious issues with f.ex. data and model poisoning, hallucinations, and prompt injections. This talk cuts through the hype on what generative AI, and especially large language models, are good for. And more importantly the talk focuses on how we keep the solutions using it safe and secure with examples of where failures to do so have ended up in the press. While the concepts of MLSecOps and LLMOps are on their own hype cycles and rising in importance, the necessary skillset can be hard to find and replacing it can be difficult as there is more terminology than clarity.\r\n\r\nAs anyone with the skills to utilize API calls can implement the capabilities of generative AI in their applications, it becomes vital to up-skill developers, ML experts and cyber security experts to ask the right questions, implement the necessary processes, and utilize required tools to keep these applications safe. DevOps and especially DevSecOps is proposed as a good mindset to begin with, but alone it will not suffice with the silent ways in which machine learning fails. This presentation focuses on the blurry lines between DevSecOps, MLOps and MLSecOps and identifies one possibility of the skillset, tooling, and processes necessary for keeping applications safe as well as identifying the terminology these skills fall under, to enable cutting through the hype, up-skilling the necessary people, and building something we can safely use that won’t land the company using it in the press.",

Thus, helping developers mitigate these risks through best-practices and frameworks can be highly beneficial for our community.\r\n\r\nThis talk will discuss some means that could be applied to build API servers (or more generally, control plane) in a way they are less susceptible to these attacks: through \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* uniformity of API server structure (this is probably quite known to most security professionals, but good to cover), and\r\n* relation-based access control (ReBAC), a superset of both RBAC and ABAC, which allows for finer-grained and declarative access control.\r\n\r\nThis gives us, a way to avoid “oops, I forgot to implement the authorization if check for this API resource (or field)” and escape the inevitability of an unmaintainable amount of imperative if checks in the API servers such as “if the authenticated user belongs to a group with magic string ‘employees’, it should have access to all documents with prefix /company_public”.\r\n\r\nA declarative model of the authorization model, and a graph based structure of the authorization state can be audited, visualized and pentested more easily than custom code for each resource in the API.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Lucas will do a demo of this paradigm working in action.

Its API server has a formalized uniform “[flow control](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/debug-cluster/flow-control/) -> [authentication](authentication) -> [authorization](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy/) -> [validation of request body](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/validating-admission-policy/)” request chain before any “business level” logic is applied, and at the end [audit logs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/audit/) are generated as configured.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, Relation-based access control (ReBAC) has increasingly been studied and applied industry. The [ANSI/INCITS Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) standard](https://standards.incits.org/apps/group_public/project/details.php?project_id=2328) was released in 2016, and Google wrote about their global and consistent [ReBAC system in 2019](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/). In recent years, there are good reference implementations of ReBAC data models available, such as [PM-Master](https://pm-master.github.io/pm-master/) (NGAC), [SpiceDB](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb) and [OpenFGA](https://github.com/openfga/openfga) (Zanzibar). ReBAC declaratively models the authorization state as a graph with nodes and directed edges, and is able to support both RBAC and ABAC flows within its data model, as well as naturally graph-based authorization types (user X can have recursive access to folder Y’s children documents).\r\n\r\nLucas has implemented a [PoC for this in a Kubernetes context](https://github.com/luxas/kube-rebac-authorizer), re-implementing the [RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) and [Node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/node/) authorizers using Google Zanzibar-inspired data model; however in the talk we’ll not focus on Kubernetes-specific details but cover more generic key take-aways that developers can apply in their API servers and control planes.",

This could be used by an attacker with sufficient access in the tenant to hide their activities and make attribution difficult. As part of the talk we will provide a brief background on the Azure Monitor service and how it interacts with the other core services within the platform and explain the differences between standard tenant users, external accounts and guest accounts. We will then explore some of the example scenarios we have reviewed and present a demo of the issue within an Entra ID tenant.

This presentation will unravel an intriguing narrative where a seemingly innocuous delve into an unusual domain metamorphoses into a meticulous bug bounty exploration, ultimately unveiling profound vulnerabilities and leading to a full compromise of company infrastructure. In a span of 2.5 weeks, a seemingly inconsequential expired domain metamorphoses into a treacherous trap, illuminating weaknesses in Rancher, Kubernetes, and varied client endpoints. This journey, punctuated by failed attempts and discarded research, is a testament to the relentless pursuit of cybersecurity knowledge and the potential rewards of diligent, innovative exploration.",
                "description": "In this deeply technical talk, I'll chronicle my bug bounty hacking journey that started with the discovery of a peculiar domain and spiraled into callbacks, tokens and successful exploitation of the target in most interesting way.\r\n\r\nThe journey began with the stumble upon an anomalous domain and the pivot to an expired one via its IP address, subsequently purchased and set up with wildcard DNS, revealing incoming Rancher fleet agent requests with tokens. After reporting this anomaly to the bug bounty program a proof of the impact of the finding was requested.\r\n\r\nWith every twist, the expedition took unexpected turns; setting up servers, spoofing responses, and achieving Remote Code Execution from wrong parts of the software, continually oscillating between breakthroughs and dead ends. This thorough exploration uncovered vulnerabilities in Kubernetes/Rancher, leading to a new strategies and methodologies, each step illuminating new facets of the intricate security labyrinth that this CTF like quest offered!\r\n\r\nVenturing further into the unknown, modifications in URI and bearer tokens connected the target clients to a hacker controlled Rancher server and allowed to control the target nodes. With each step forward, new doors opened and the mounting of the host root disk inside the container allowed for a comprehensive breach of the target server!\r\n\r\nThis presentation will not just be a recount of the intricate process leading to a $10,001 bounty but a profound insight into the fragile essence of forgotten domains, a testament to the relentless pursuit of knowledge in the ever-evolving world of hacking. Audience members will leave with enriched understandings of the vulnerabilities lurking within domains and an enlightened perspective on the benefits of the bug bounty programs.",

Ken Wilber’s Integral Theory is a holistic framework on human, societal and cultural development that provides one of the most comprehensive toolkits for understanding motivation and change. I will present the main tenets of the theory and suggest ways how security professionals and the hacker community can benefit from these insights.",
                "description": "This presentation is about the application of Ken Wilber’s Integral Theory in the field of cybersecurity. The conference theme “Don’t believe the hype” raises attention, among other things, on the human factor – the multitude of ways human agents can be tricked into compromising confidentiality, authenticity and in turn a plethora of valuable assets.\r\n \r\nWe also acknowledge the age of AI as a new situation for security professionals. It provides more powerful tools for threat actors and defenders alike. What does this mean for the security and hacking community?\r\n\r\nThere is no one-size-fits-all solution. We come from different backgrounds, have different motivations, provide security for different sectors and have various combinations of experience and responsibility. Hacking as a technical craft implies breaking boundaries and being able to create something previously unknown, but these skills on their own do not warrant socially responsible behavior. Politics, culture, the historical situation and need for recognition among peers can all play a part. Even morality itself ultimately proves to be a vague phenomenon.\r\n\r\nHow can Ken Wilber’s Integral Theory be of use here? Sometimes called A Theory of Everything, this framework integrates the key findings of dozens of developmental psychology theories in a systematic way. First, it deals with the Four Quadrants: 1) our inner experience, 2) our intersubjectivity, 3) our physical or perceived personality and 4) our place in social systems.\r\n\r\nSecond, it presents levels of development, equally resonating with human psychological growth, historical change and socio-political systems. This is the core of his theory, and it sheds clear light to our current age: how geopolitical tensions escalate between democratic and autocratic systems, how we deal with the post-truth era and the ecological crisis, and how we need to rethink agency with the rise of more capable AI systems.\r\n\r\nIn the suggested presentation, I will first present the main tenets of Wilber’s theory and then provide a set of feasible applications for the Disobey community, ie. a toolbox for security professionals. The second part will build on current and most relevant cybersecurity topics near the conference date. Although not deeply technical as such, the talk will do its best to appreciate hands-on themes that most attendees can relate to.\r\n\r\nI believe Wilber’s theory can enhance critical thinking and clarity of vision. Further, I hope it can bring a fresh perspective on how we understand motivation and community in the context of security, as well as how the global situation might unfold.",

                "abstract": "Cross-account IAM role trust relationships can enable complex and hard to detect attack paths in AWS environments. In large AWS organizations, analysing such paths manually is practically impossible due to many different configurations involved. But what if we could simplify such analysis a bit?\r\n\r\nThis talk will outline how attackers could exploit AWS IAM role trust relationships and demonstrate how to reveal the routes attackers could take inside your AWS environment.",
                "description": "An account in AWS acts as a security boundary, and resources in one account are by default isolated from those in other accounts. However, this boundary can be crossed by assuming IAM roles that are configured to trust IAM principals in other accounts. While such cross-account roles have many valid use cases, they sometimes enable attack paths that could be exploited by attackers to move laterally between accounts of an AWS organization.\r\n\r\nIdentifying such paths manually in large AWS environments by reviewing all the relevant configurations is practically impossible. AWS environment can have hundreds of accounts and thousands of IAM roles, all having multiple IAM policies affecting the effective access paths. \r\n\r\nIn the presentation, I will describe typical ways attackers could exploit cross-account trust relationships in AWS environments. Moreover, I'll present how graph-theory can be applied to analyse large AWS organizations to identify potentially dangerous cross-account access paths.\r\n\r\nThe talk presents tooling that models IAM configurations of an AWS environment as a graph and performs automatic analysis of IAM policies to identify effective assume-role paths. The tooling presented in this talk will be open-sourced. \r\n\r\nThe methodology and tooling presented in this talk are useful for security professionals for assessing the security of large AWS environments and removing unnecessary attack paths.",

Hundreds of these teams strive to protect their respective corners of the internet from incidents and vulnerabilities. Unlike security operations centres, they usually don't have direct control of the protected systems. Instead, they rely on information exchange with their peers and co-operation networks to get timely advice on current threats to their customers.\r\n\r\nInformation exchange might not sound like much, but in practice it has saved us all from harm many times over. Come hear some of the stories.",
                "description": "The first team dedicated computer emergency response was founded in 1988 after one of the first worms had infected a major portion of the Internet of that time. Tiger teams testing systems to prevent incidents from occurring had already been at work for over a decade, though mostly for classified governmental systems.\r\n\r\nToday, there are hundreds of incident response teams all over the world. They are all different in background, jurisdiction, and offered services. Many of them, often called cyber security centres, combine traditional incident response capabilities with preventive services such as product certification and systems auditing.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I first set the scene for different variations of incident response teams: governmental, national, private, commercial, product-related, network, military, national and other flavors. I then detail the different kinds of services and functions these teams have, from first response and triage to incident analysis and further on to situational awareness and other proactive services. Then, I describe what the co-operation mechanisms are and how they operate. Along the way I'll focus on the different kinds of customers and how they benefit from the work of the teams.\r\n\r\nI will often use the Finnish NCSC-FI as an example as that's where my personal experience comes from. I will use stories from handling actual incidents wherever possible to illustrate my points.",

Participants will learn how to perform Wi-Fi reconnaissance, identify configuration errors in wireless networks, create fake access points for launching phishing attacks, evade WIDS, and more. The workshop is completely virtual, and participants will have access to a laboratory environment where they can experiment safely. Participants should have prior knowledge of Wi-Fi attacks on open networks, WEP, WPA2-PSK, and WPA2/MGT. The workshop covers advanced techniques for Wi-Fi reconnaissance, creating custom TLS certificates, fake access point attacks, MSCHAPv2 relay attacks, password spraying, ESSID stripping, and more in environments where setting up a RogueAP on corporate networks is not possible. The workshop also highlights the importance of wireless intrusion detection systems for security teams, with an example using Nzyme. Overall, this workshop is ideal for Red Team professionals looking to enhance their Wi-Fi attack skills as another vector for easily accessing corporate networks.",

In this talk, I'll walk you through how I did it, so that you can too—all from the comfort of your sofa. You'll learn how simple it can be to help protect the innocent by making life harder for criminals, all while having fun and learning new skills at the same time.",

From deobfuscating malicious code to tracing the breadcrumbs to a Telegram account, I'll unveil each layer of the operation. I'll also discuss responsible reporting of this information and how to take action. Finally, I'll demonstrate how to turn the tables on the criminals by feeding them convincing yet entirely random data with the hopes that it’ll throw a wrench in their operations.",
