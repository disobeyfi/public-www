								<h4>UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS COMPETITION</h4>


								<p>Find NotMyNick inside the venue without authorised access credentials. If you already have a badge, you will be disqualified.</p>

                                <p>The first to hack themselves into the event wins an official badge and entry to the event. And only the first one will be awarded &ndash; any later ones will be politely escorted out. </p>

                                <p>Please note that this competition may lead to physical harm, removal from the venue and depending on techniques used having the authorities called on you. </p>

                                <p>Don’t get caught. </p>

								<h4>DISOBEY BADGE PUZZLE</h4>
								<p>Ever since the second Disobey, there has been some form of a badge and a puzzle that goes with it. While the puzzles have been unique, the common thread is that you won't be able to do the challenge alone. You need to recruit some friends into your team to be able to gather all the clues and solve all the riddles &ndash; not to mention to hack all the things.</p>

                                <p>During the previous years, you have had to connect your badge to other badges, decode morse code from LEDs, etc. One thing is certain: this year something is different from the previous year.</p>

								<h4>DISOBEY CTF</h4>
								<p>In a CTF, teams compete in solving hacker-minded challenges of varying types and skill levels. More solves, more points. Most points, victory.</p>
								<ul style="font-family: monospace">
                                        <li>0x0000: The maximum team size is 10 people.</li>
                                        <li>0x0027: The CTF is for event participants only, unfortunately participating outside the event won't be possible. This is due to resources and the physical nature of some challenges.</li>
                                        <li>0x006a: scoring method will be dynamic, i.e., <i>"the more solves the challenge has, the less points it's worth"</i>.</li>
                                        <li>0x017e: A(t least a) wired network connection (1000BASE-T) will be provided, so you might want to prepare for that.</li>
                                        <li>0x02ac: The CTF starts on Friday afternoon and ends on Saturday in the evening. Details TBA.</li>
                                        <li>0xff8d: The winners are announced and objects are given at the Awards Ceremony on Saturday.</li>
                                </ul>

								<p>Are you ready for creativity and out of the box thinking? Scavenger hunt is back and will test your skills on multiple levels. The game will consist of 25 tasks and the winner is the team (yes, team) that gains the most points and that completes task number 25.

                               <p>
                               &ndash; An empty box with a twist<br>
                               &ndash; An actual object made from recycled material
                                </p>
