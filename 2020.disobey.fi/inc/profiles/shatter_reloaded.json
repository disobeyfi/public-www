	"subtitle": "Reviving shatter attacks to escape sandboxes and evade endpoint security products",
	"synopsis": "Shatter attacks were all the rage in 2003 but were quickly neutralized by DEP, UIPI and Session 0 isolation. 15 years later, confronted with a commercial sandbox product on the one hand, and with state-of-the-art security endpoint products on the other – we brought Shatter attacks back to life, extending and weaponizing them to be useful once more. We’ll start this talk with a quick intro to the classical Shatter attacks and continue to share the full, low-level, details on our reincarnation of them, including a live demo.",
