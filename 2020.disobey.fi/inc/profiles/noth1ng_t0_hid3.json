	"subtitle": "Should we fix privacy?",
	"synopsis": "This talk revisits the theme of personal privacy in the digital world, this time centring around the \"I've got nothing to hide\" argument. A beam of intensive light is shed on the motivation behind caring about one's privacy. We go in depth into what we can do to stay private and should we even try to do it at all. We talk about where we as an global society were able to fix privacy and where we have failed. New topics previously not covered are discussed, such as herd immunity and certification programs.",
