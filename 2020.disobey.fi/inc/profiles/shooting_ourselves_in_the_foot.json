	"synopsis": "Do you know what happens when your systems are hit with traffic exceeding the available bandwidth? I know. Now. In this presentation I'm telling a story how we were able to organize a (legal) DDoS exercise against ourselves and what we learned from it. Asymmetric or application level DoS attacks respecting the organization's bandwith are easy, anyone can do it. We took the hard way - attacking the real, live, production environment with no training wheels or safety net.",
