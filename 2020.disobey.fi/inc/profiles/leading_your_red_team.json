We created a comprehensive model for leading a red team engagement which emphasizes the collaboration between pentesters, developers and the client, capitalizing on communication and agile working methods.\n\nThe workshop covers the full scope of a red team engagement. Focus will be on planning the engagement and remediations:\n- Plan – Are we doing the right things?\n- Engage – Are we doing the things right?\n- Provide – What should we do next?\n\nThe workshop consists of lecture and short exercises in intelligence, targeting and planning of a red teaming engagement. No computers will be used, just pen, paper and a creative mind.",
