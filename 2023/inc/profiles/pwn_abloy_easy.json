			"bio": "When Finland faced the first round of covid pandemic I did not get hit by covid, but I got hit by the locksport interest. Since then I have pwned several lock types, including those different Abloy lock types. \n\nIn the locksport scene I play with a nickname 'Idanhurja'. Lock Pickers United awarded me with \"black belt\" -picker status in 2021. I have shared some of my learning in youtube. \n\nI am also interested in cyber security in hands on fashion. I completed pwn.college and been playing in different CTF-competitions. \n\nMy professional life so far has not been related to cyber security / physical security, but I am always open for interesting opportunities.",
