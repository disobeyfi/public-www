	"synopsis": "In October of 2020 Vastaamo, a chain of psychotherapy clinics with over 30.000 patients, disclosed that their database had been stolen. The database contained the therapist’s notes and personally identifying information for tens of thousands of Finnish citizens. The criminal, known as ransom_man, was trying to exert pressure on the company by taking their demands public. The series of events that unfolded would eventually cause Vastaamo to go bankrupt and see the CEO and founder of the company lose his fortune. This story is gathered from public sources and tells what happened from the beginning to today.",
