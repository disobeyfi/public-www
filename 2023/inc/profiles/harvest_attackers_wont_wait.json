	"synopsis": "Cryptographically relevant quantum computers do not exist yet as far as we know, but your secrets do. Final NIST PQC algorithms are expected in 2024. How to protect long-term secrets from harvesting attacks while standardization is in progress in NIST and IETF. Learn how the quantum-threat can be tackled using quantum-safe Secure Shell or IPsec tunnel to embrace the quantum-safe world ahead of the curve.",
