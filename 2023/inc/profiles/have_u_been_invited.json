	"synopsis": "This is a story about my journey to find logic bugs in macOS. During 2020 - 2022 I found a bunch of them and reported three major vulnerabilities from macOS. I will explain my methodology to find them and walk you through an exploit chain that compromises users' sensitive data with zero click.\n\nThis chain starts with a zero-click vulnerability that I found in macOS Calendar. It allows an attacker to add or delete arbitrary files inside the Calendar sandbox environment. This will lead to arbitrary code execution. <del>I will demonstrate how the vulnerability can be combined with Gatekeeper evasion and TCC evasion to compromise users’ sensitive data.</del>\n\nEdit: Some of the patches are still coming so unfortunately I can not disclose the full vulnerability chain yet. Instead, I will concentrate more on the first part of the vulnerability.",
