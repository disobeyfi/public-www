							<li><b>Any instructions on how to locate and find the event?</b><br>
							See <a href="practical">Practical</a></li>

							<li><b>Is there an age limit for the event?</b><br>
							Yes, 18. We will check your ID only in situations where your apparent age is unclear.</li>

							<li><b>When do the doors open?</b><br>
							Friday 17: the doors open at 11:30am. The official program ends at 10pm.<br>
							Saturday 18: the doors open at 10:00am. The official program ends at 10pm.</li>

							<li><b>I have the ticket in my email. Do I get a physical one?</b><br>
							You'll receive a bracelet at the counter once inside the venue. We will exchange your tickets
							using the <b>receipt (the 'Invoice' attachment in the email, not a QR code)</b> from Holvi you've got, it
                                                        contains the information needed. In case of problems, use the “Special Circumstances” queue.<br>
							Note: You will be getting all your tickets at once, so if you hoarded an obscene amount of
							tickets for your company, we won't be distributing them to your employees.</li>

							<li><b>I purchased a ticket via Holvi but never received the receipt. What should I do?</b><br>
							Contact us and we'll find the ticket for you.</li>

							<li><b>Any food at the venue?</b><br>
							There are three cafes and two restaurants at Kaapelitehdas. You can check their opening
							hours <a href="https://www.kaapelitehdas.fi/en/taste-and-sense">here</a><br>
							Also, the Ruoholahti mall (500 meters by foot) and its surroundings also offer fast food
							places, restaurants, off-licence and grocery stores. Check them out
							<a href="https://kauppakeskusruoholahti.fi/ravintolat/">here</a></li>

							<li><b>From whom do I get information during the event?</b><br>
							Look for the persons with the text “staff” behind their t-shirts. Also visit the cloakroom or the
							infodesk near the entrance.</li>

							<li><b>Will there be an afterparty?</b><br>
							Yes; this year, we have decided to spread the afterparty to Biitsi, hotel Clarion Skybar and
							Huutokonttori. All you need to do is gather your people and decide where to continue the
							celebrations.<br>
							See <a href="practical">Practical</a> for more information about the afterparty locations.</li>
